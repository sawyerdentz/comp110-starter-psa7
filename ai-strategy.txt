The ai attempts to get the player to a position where there is 1 stick left. 
It does this by forcing the player to have a certain number of sticks starting at 1 and going up by 4.
ex: 1,5,9,13,etc.
This works because both the ai and player can take a maximum of 3 sticks, so whatever the player does, the ai will be able to force them down the pattern.
If the player falls into this pattern, the player will not be able to get out and they will eventually have to take the last stick.
